            <p>Steve's mission: To explain Semantic Elements and use them</p>
          </header>
            <p>In web design, a semantic element is a style of HTML code that is both functional and descriptive.  Its name directly conveys what it does so that it speaks to the person building the website as well as the browser that hosts it.  Without semantic elements, the i tag could be used to create and indicate text in italics. With semantic elements, the em tag (indicating “emphasis”) is used.  The former is a technical indication of italics, whereas the latter is descriptive and technical at the same time.   By serving descriptive and functional purposes concurrently, it makes code easier to read, understand, build and maintain.  It also improves accessibility for users with disabilities as the descriptor and its function are semantically identical. </p>
